 <div class="h1"><h1>About Us</h1></div>
    <div class="p1"><p>Pooja Petals Boutique was founded by Mansi Karn, a dedicated 21-year-old woman from New Delhi whose passion for crafting traditional Hindu flower garlands began long before her business did. Raised in a lower-income household, Mansi has always dreamed of earning a university degree at the University of Delhi. She has the academic merit but not the financial support to afford tuition, so she turned her love for floral artistry into an opportunity. In December 2024, she opened her own small business creating handcrafted flower garlands for Hindu festivals and spiritual ceremonies. Each piece reflects her skill, creativity, and deep respect for tradition, offering customers garlands that are meaningful, fresh, and made with heartfelt care.</p></div>

        Since its launch, Pooja Petals Boutique has focused on growing its reach and strengthening its presence within the local community. The shop continues to refine its process by improving order handling, inventory organization, and customer service. Although still developing its online and operational systems, the boutique is steadily building a reputation in Gujarat for reliable quality and thoughtful craftsmanship. With every new customer, Pooja Petals Boutique moves closer to expanding its offerings, increasing accessibility, and becoming a trusted destination for traditional flower garlands. The business continues to move forward with optimism, aiming to bring beauty, culture, and heartfelt artistry to celebrations across the region.
